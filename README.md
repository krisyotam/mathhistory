This project uses the book [A History of Mathematics]() as im sure you could tell by the title. It is apart of my [Classical Mathematics]() Education. The goal here is to while reading the book, bring it to life. To add to it movies, books, articles, dialogues, ect. 
on the topics discussed in any given chapter. To expand out what could not have fit in nearly one book. The plan is to at a later point in time implement this into my [Reformed Mathematics]() education, and [Classical Education]() Curricula.
